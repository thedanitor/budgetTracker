## Description

This full-stack progressive web application allows the user to add funds and expenses to keep track of their budget.
It can be used offline and will then be updated once back online.

The app was created with the following user story in mind:

*AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.*

## Technologies Used

* Bootstrap: CSS framework
* Express: web framework
* MongoDB: database
* Mongoose: database ORM
* IndexedDB: client-side storage for offline functionality

## Usage

User can enter the transaction name and amount in the text boxes and then click either Add or Subtract Funds.
The total is displayed at the top of the page and a graph of the total with each transaction is displayed below.
The app can be downloaded to the user's device and will continue functioning without an internet connection.
